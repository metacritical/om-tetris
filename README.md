# OM-TETRIS

Game of tetris written in clojure and a bit of Om/Cljs.

I agree i shouldnt have used om/cljs since it keeps changing and it is bad compared 
to reagent which is simple and works. But i used Om/cljs just to see what is all the fuss 
about.

Writing Tetris in clojurescript is lot of Fun. Yes fun is important, those of you think fun 
i not important are not having a good time writing code.

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel
